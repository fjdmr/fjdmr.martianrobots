To run the API do an HTTPPOST request to  /martianrobots with a Json body similar to the following example:

{
    "WorldX": 5,
    "WorldY": 3,
    "Robots":[{"X": 1, "Y": 1, "Direction": "E", "Instructions": "RFRFRFRF"},
    {"X": 3, "Y": 2, "Direction": "N", "Instructions": "FRRFLLFFRRFLL"},
    {"X": 0, "Y": 3, "Direction": "W", "Instructions": "LLFFFRFLFL"}]
}
